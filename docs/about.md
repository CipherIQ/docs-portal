# About CipherIQ

## Making Cryptography Visible, Measurable, and Manageable

CipherIQ is the industry's first **cryptographic observability platform**, delivering complete visibility into enterprise cryptographic posture. We combine static asset discovery with runtime network monitoring to solve the fundamental challenge organizations face in the quantum era: *you cannot secure what you cannot see.*

---

## Our Mission

As quantum computing advances and regulatory requirements tighten, organizations worldwide face an unprecedented challenge—migrating their cryptographic infrastructure to quantum-safe standards. But before any migration can begin, you need to know what you have.

CipherIQ makes this possible. We illuminate the hidden world of cryptography within your enterprise, revealing not just what's configured, but what's actually running in production.

> **The CipherIQ Difference:** Configuration files tell you what *could* happen. Network monitoring shows you what *is* happening. Together, they reveal the complete truth.

## The CipherIQ Platform

### CipherIQ Generator

Our static discovery engine inventories all cryptographic assets—certificates, keys, algorithms, configurations, and protocols—through automated scanning of filesystems, configuration files, and binaries.

### CipherIQ Monitor

Our runtime analytics engine observes live network traffic using deep packet inspection to capture TLS handshakes, cipher suite negotiations, protocol versions, and certificate usage in production environments.

### Unified Intelligence

By correlating static configuration with runtime behavior, CipherIQ detects drift, validates compliance, and prioritizes post-quantum cryptography (PQC) migration based on actual risk exposure—not theoretical configuration.

---

## Built on Open Standards

CipherIQ generates standardized **Cryptographic Bills of Materials (CBOM)** in CycloneDX format, ensuring seamless integration with existing security operations workflows, SIEM platforms, and compliance systems. We actively participate in standards body development, helping shape the future of cryptographic transparency.

## Leadership

### Marco Graziano
**Founder & CEO**

Marco brings extensive experience in product leadership, delivering both consumer electronics and enterprise-grade security software. His rigorous approach to requirements engineering and security-first design philosophy drives CipherIQ's technical excellence.

Marco holds deep expertise in cryptographic systems, compliance frameworks, and systems programming, with a proven track record of building products that meet the highest standards of quality and security.

## Why Now?

> **The Quantum Clock is Ticking:** Adversaries are already harvesting encrypted data today for decryption tomorrow in "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.

The window for cryptographic transformation is open—and closing:

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| NIST PQC Standards | Finalized (2024) |
| NSA Migration Mandates | In Effect |
| Federal PQC Deadline | 2035 |

Organizations that gain cryptographic visibility today will lead the transition to quantum-safe infrastructure. Those that wait risk falling behind on compliance, security, and competitive positioning.

**CipherIQ is your partner in this essential transformation.**
